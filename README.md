# Data Tracking Template
- Generic app template for AngularJs. Use cases for tracking information over large periods of time. Built with the intention of understanding AngularJs on a deeper level.

# Goal:
- Learn AngularJs by building a general app template that can be used in many different ways. Some topics I've come up with include:
    - Kanban style note taking board
    - Inventory or objectives for a game
    - Workout tracker
    - Anything that involves objects containing a list or lists of more objects

# Notes:
- App layout is starting to become a little sloppy, so I need to reorganize some of the structure after the bare functionality is working. (I'd like to have it working by 4/1 to have something to show for).
- After that, start building an automated data tracking section.
- Eventually style everything.

- Overall I think this project was a big success, even if it were to never be as good as the vision was for it. I now understand how AngularJs uses MVA; what $scope means and what it does, how injection works, templates/directives, and just the overall functionality of a single page app. It has enabled me to be more productive and effective at work, allowing me to read and understand code on a deeper level.

# To Do:
- Create a save function for each service, rather than one for app. Save what is relevant to the scope
- Update API to handle those individual requests instead of the entire object at once

- Archive: Show and hide rows of records for each item

- "Fullscreen" to view one object on entire page (logging and archive)
