# Data Tracking Template
- Generic app template with multiple use cases. Main purpose for tracking information over large periods of time.

# Goal:
- Build a general app template that can be used in many different ways. Some other topics I've come up with include:
    - Kanban style note taking board
    - Inventory or objectives for a game
    - Workout tracker
    - Anything that involves objects containing a list or lists of more objects

# Notes:
- Still early in developement so I don't have the complete vision laid out for it yet, but I do have at least 1 real world scenario where I think I can put it to good use.
- I want to keep it generalized because I think a lot of apps operate in a similar fashion and it would be nice to not have to reinvent the wheel everytime. I'm sure stuff like this already exist but I want to sharpen my JavaScript/AngularJs skills with something that could actually be used and bennefit others.
- This project will remain open-source and anyone who would like to use it for their own purpose is more than welcome
